  ## Installation
  No installation necessary

  ## Usage
  Users can add expenses and deposits to their budget using the intuitive tracker app. Even better, the app can even be used if the user's internet connection is interrupted. If the user enters a transaction while offline, the browser will cache the data & sync the transaction with the server/database once the connection resumes. 

  ## Contributing
  Anything available for open-source contributions will be listed on the GitHub repository Issues page and marked accordingly.

  ## Tests
  No tests available at this time.
